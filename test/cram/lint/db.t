No check on WIs without the DB:

  $ okra lint -e weekly.md
  okra: [WARNING] Conflicting titles:
  - "Property-Based Testing for Multicore"
  - "Invalid name"
  [OK]: weekly.md

The DB can be passed through the [--okr-db] option:

  $ okra lint -e --work-item-db admin/data/db.csv weekly.md
  okra: [WARNING] Conflicting titles:
  - "Property-Based Testing for Multicore"
  - "Invalid name"
  [OK]: weekly.md

The DB can be looked up in the [repo-dir] passed through the [-C]/[--repo-dir] option:
  $ okra lint -e -C admin weekly.md
  okra: [WARNING] Conflicting titles:
  - "Property-Based Testing for Multicore"
  - "Invalid name"
  [OK]: weekly.md
